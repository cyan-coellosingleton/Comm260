                <p>I'm Cyan Coello, a girl who may have been born in California, but who has found her home in the utter
                    frozen wasteland that is North Dakota.
                    Right now, I am currently a Sophomore at North Dakota State University working towards a Bachelor of
                    Arts in Computer Science.
                    Throughout high school I found lots of joy in writing, photography, and the arts in general!
                    Since beginning college lots of those passions have been pushed to the side to make more time for my
                    studies, but now I think it is high time I started doing things I enjoy again.
                    Here on my website, you will be able to find some of my photography, creative writing from high
                    school and I hope to add new additions soon!
                    I also want to start having more fun with my major. I love to play video games and I want to share
                    my journey to, hopefully, becoming a video game developer.
                    So, thanks for stopping by and I hope you enjoy your time on my site!
                    <br>- Cyan
                </p>
